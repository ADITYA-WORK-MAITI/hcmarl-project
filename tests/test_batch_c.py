"""Batch C long-run stability regression tests (2026-04-15).

Covers:
    C1 — Entropy anneal wiring: every production training config declares
         entropy_coeff_final (target 0.01 to match MAPPO standard). Prior
         state had entropy_coeff=0.05 with no anneal on most configs, which
         blocks convergence in the final ~10% of training.
    C2 — 3CC-r long-run numerical stability: 60K single-step Euler trajectory
         under sustained load then rest. Invariants that must hold at every
         step: NaN-free, each compartment in [0,1], MR+MA+MF == 1,
         monotone MF rise under sustained work, monotone MF decay in rest.
    C3 — ECBF post-step barrier integrity: the continuous-time guarantee
         must survive discretization. Stress-test with worst-case fresh
         workers + heavy sustained load; barrier_violations counter must
         stay at 0 across the full trajectory.
    C4 — Dense safety_cost parity: warehouse_env and pettingzoo_wrapper
         both import from hcmarl.envs.reward_functions.safety_cost and
         produce bit-identical values. The function must be dense
         (excess-above-theta), not binary.
