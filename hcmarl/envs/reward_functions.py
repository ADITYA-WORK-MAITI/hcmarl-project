HC-MARL Canonical Reward and Cost Functions.

Single source of truth for all reward/cost computation across environments.
Matches the mathematical modelling document exactly:

  Reward (Eq 33 + Eq 32):
    r_i(t) = ln(max(U(i,j) - D_i(MF_i), epsilon)) - lambda_safety * violations

  where:
    U(i,j) = sum of task demands T_L^(j) across muscle groups  (Def 7.1)
    D_i(MF) = kappa * MF^2 / (1 - MF)                         (Eq 32)
    epsilon > 0 small (Eq 31: rest surplus)
    violations = number of muscles where MF_m > theta_max_m

  Cost (for MAPPO-Lagrangian):
    c_i(t) = 1 if any muscle exceeds theta_max, else 0         (binary)

Note on the log-transform: The NSWF objective (Eq 33) maximises
sum_i ln(surplus_i). We use ln(surplus) as the per-step reward so that
the RL objective (maximise cumulative reward) directly corresponds to
the NSWF objective (maximise product of surpluses via log-sum).

When surplus <= 0 (worker too fatigued for the task), reward = ln(epsilon),
a large negative value that strongly discourages overwork. This matches
the math doc: when D_i exceeds U(i,j), the worker should rest.
